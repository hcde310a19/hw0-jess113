# Description of your program (part 7)
# In order to count the number of words in a document, start with 0 from the first character of the document,
# reading character by character from left to right, top to bottom, add 1 to the number of words with every space encountered.

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
# I think my instructions above quite succintly satisfies the requirement. It's not particularly hard but certainly a challenge
# to make sure that someone cannot interpret the instructions in any other way than what's intended.

# I have never had any experience with Python before so I'm excited this course can introduce to me a new coding language.
# I'm also hoping this class can help me more with CSS, this is something I think will be the most useful to me
# but I still need help on.
